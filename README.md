# Gr-PCSBL
Extending the PC-SBL to low bit quantization case through the Gr-SBL framwork

The function contains three mode including the "point","extend" and "extend-2D" that are corresponding to 
the no-relation, 1D-relation and 2D-relation between adjacent elements.

Note that the code made some adaptation for distributed MIMO radars where the inverse of covariance matrix are calculated in a more efficient manner.
